# Drought Prediction Benchmark

## Overview
This repository provides a benchmark framework for predicting the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in South Australia for future one-month and three-month periods. The goal is to evaluate various forecasting models and methodologies for drought prediction using both traditional and machine learning-based approaches.

## Features
- **Predicting SPEI**: Focuses on one-month and three-month ahead forecasts.
- **Benchmarking Models**: Includes classical statistical models, machine learning models, and foundation models.
- **Data Sources**: Incorporates climate model outputs and observational data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Standardized evaluation framework to compare model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilizes techniques such as Granger causality and PCMCI for causal discovery.
- **Foundation Model Exploration**: Investigates in-context learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches.

## Data
The dataset consists of meteorological and climate-related variables used for drought prediction. The main data sources are:

### üìç **Primary Data Sources**

   - We use the **30-day SPEI (SPEI-30)** at **0.25¬∞ spatial resolution**.
   - Time range: **1982‚Äì2021**.
   - Based on ERA5 precipitation and Singer‚Äôs potential evapotranspiration.

3. **NINO Index** ([NOAA PSL](https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/dashboard.html))
   - ENSO-related indices used as additional predictors for drought forecasting.
   - Includes **NINO12, NINO34, NINO4** and the **Dipole Mode Index (DMI)**.
