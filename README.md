# Drought Prediction Benchmark

## Overview
This repository provides a benchmark framework for predicting the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in South Australia for future one-month and three-month periods. The goal is to evaluate various forecasting models and methodologies for drought prediction using both traditional and machine learning-based approaches.

## Features
- **Predicting SPEI**: Focuses on one-month and three-month ahead forecasts.
- **Benchmarking Models**: Includes classical statistical models, machine learning models, and foundation models.
- **Data Sources**: Incorporates climate model outputs and observational data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Standardized evaluation framework to compare model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilizes techniques such as Granger causality and PCMCI for causal discovery.
- **Foundation Model Exploration**: Investigates in-context learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches.

## Data
The dataset consists of:
- **NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1**: Meteorological features.
- **SPEI-GD Dataset**: The first global multi-scale daily SPEI dataset (Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.8060268](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8060268)).
  - We specifically use the **30-day SPEI (spei30)** data at 0.25Â° spatial resolution from 1982 to 2021.
  - Data is based on ERA5 precipitation and Singer's potential evapotranspiration.
  - Available in NetCDF format.
